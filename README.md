# library
A collection of implemented structures and algorithms to be used as a reference or imported

Here's where I'll put implementations of algorithms and data structures I come across in class, or ones that peak my interest.  
Ideally, they'll be implemented in C or C++, wrapped by a python interface to fulfull the "importable" feature.  
  
If you care, I chose the name `library` because:
- its a common name for reusable code packaged in a 'module' of some sort and 
- its also an institution where resources are stored for study, research and reference.  
  
Fingers crossed this doesn't become another dead repo that I forget about. I'm putting this out there to pressure myself into not letting that happen.
